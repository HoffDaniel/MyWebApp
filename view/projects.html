                The idea: to provide an application which helps to better understand certain algorithms by simultaneously visualising two or more algorithms at the same time as they progress through the problems search space, 
                and also providing an UI to manipulate parameters while the algorithms are running. 
                An object oriented approach was carried out to be able to quickly add new problems and algorithms
                to the system as there is a vast number of nature inspired algorithms and optimisation problems (which is constantly increasing).
                <br><br>
                Optimisation Problems implemented:
                <br><br>
                -   Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
                <br><br>
                Algorithms implemented:
                <br><br>        
                -   Genetic Algorithm (GA)

                This was my BSc final year development project. It was the first time developing a web application and I used: 
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js,and MySQL/SQL,
                The idea was to create an application from which one can book rooms. Additionally the 
                application would analyse the bookings and try to block certain rooms from being bookable 
                to try and space out crowds. Ideally this would reduce the spread of covid and alikes. 
                Alas this feature is yet to be implemented, it is on my list for future projects.
