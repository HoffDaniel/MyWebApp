                As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Intelligent Systems, I'm excited to showcase my skills and experience in the fields of Computer Science, Robotics, and AI. <br>
                This webpage is a project that I've been working on to learn and practice building a webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and use it as a Sandbox to explore technologies. <br>
                It also serves as a portfolio for my job hunting, as well as a place to share my interests and experiences. <br> 
                <br>

                I will be continously adding and updating the webpage. In the meantime, feel free to explore my                 
                <a class="content-link" href="/view/projects.html" style="display: inline;">Portfolio</a> section to see some of the work I've done in the past,
